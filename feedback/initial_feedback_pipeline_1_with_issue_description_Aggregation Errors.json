    "issue_description": "The issue description mentions 'Aggregation Errors' but there doesn't seem to be any aggregation operation in the provided code. The code reads a dataset, preprocesses it, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a RandomForestClassifier model, makes predictions, and then evaluates the model's performance. There are no aggregation operations such as groupby, sum, average, etc.",
    "suggested_fix": "If you are expecting some aggregation operations in your code, please review your requirements and update the code accordingly. If not, the issue description might be incorrect.",
    "code_snippet": ""

  {
    "issue_description": "The code does not handle missing values for all features. It only handles missing values for the 'Age' feature by filling them with the mean age.",
    "suggested_fix": "Check if other features also have missing values and handle them appropriately. You can use the pandas function isnull().sum() to check for missing values in the dataframe.",
    "code_snippet": "missing_values = X.isnull().sum()\nprint(missing_values)"

    "issue_description": "The code does not perform any feature scaling. Some machine learning algorithms can perform poorly if the features are not on a similar scale.",
    "suggested_fix": "Consider applying feature scaling to the input features. The StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing can be used for this purpose.",
    "code_snippet": "from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nX_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)\nX_test = scaler.transform(X_test)"
