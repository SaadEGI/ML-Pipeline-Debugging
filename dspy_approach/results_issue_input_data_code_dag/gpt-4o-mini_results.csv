../../pipelines_examples\cross_validation\example-0.py,gpt-4o-mini,False,No issues detected related to cross-validation errors in the provided code.,No fix required as no issues were found.,1
../../pipelines_examples\data_anonymization\example-0.py,gpt-4o-mini,True,"The code does not anonymize sensitive data before processing, which can lead to privacy concerns.","Implement data anonymization techniques, such as removing or masking sensitive information, before processing the data.",1
../../pipelines_examples\data_filtering\example-0.py,gpt-4o-mini,True,"The filtering conditions applied to the dataset may not be comprehensive enough, as they only filter based on 'Age' and 'HighChol', potentially excluding relevant data points that could affect the model's performance.","Enhance the filtering criteria to include additional relevant features that may impact the 'Diabetes_binary' outcome, ensuring a more robust dataset for training.",1
../../pipelines_examples\data_imputation\example-0.py,gpt-4o-mini,True,"The code uses SimpleImputer with the strategy 'most_frequent', which may not be suitable for all datasets, especially if the missing values are not missing at random. This can lead to incorrect imputations.","Consider using a more robust imputation strategy, such as 'mean' for numerical features or 'median' for skewed distributions. Additionally, evaluate the missing data pattern and consider using KNN imputation or other advanced techniques.",1
../../pipelines_examples\data_leakage\example-0.py,gpt-4o-mini,True,"The code does not properly separate the training and testing datasets before any preprocessing steps, which can lead to data leakage if any information from the test set is used during training.",Ensure that the train-test split is performed before any preprocessing steps are applied to the data. This can be done by moving the `train_test_split` call before the preprocessing pipeline is defined and applied.,1
../../pipelines_examples\data_slicing\example-0.py,gpt-4o-mini,False,No data slicing errors detected in the provided code.,No fix required as no issues were found.,1
../../pipelines_examples\data_splitting\example-0.py,gpt-4o-mini,True,"The code uses `train_test_split` without ensuring that the labels are stratified, which can lead to imbalanced splits if the classes are not evenly distributed.","Modify the `train_test_split` function to include the `stratify` parameter, using `raw_data['score_text']` to ensure that the split maintains the proportion of classes in both training and testing datasets:
```python
train_data, test_data, train_labels, test_labels = train_test_split(prepared_data, raw_data['score_text'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=raw_data['score_text'])
```",1
../../pipelines_examples\specification_bias\example-0.py,gpt-4o-mini,True,"The model is trained on a dataset that may contain biases, particularly if the dataset is not representative of the population or if certain groups are underrepresented. This can lead to specification bias.","To mitigate specification bias, ensure that the dataset is representative of the target population. Consider using techniques such as stratified sampling, and perform exploratory data analysis to identify and address any potential biases in the data before training the model.",1
