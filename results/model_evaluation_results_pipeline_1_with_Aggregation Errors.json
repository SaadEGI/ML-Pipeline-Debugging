    "issue_description": "The issue description mentions 'Aggregation Errors' but there doesn't seem to be any aggregation operation in the provided code. The code reads a dataset, preprocesses it, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a RandomForestClassifier model, makes predictions, and then evaluates the model's performance. There are no aggregation operations such as groupby, sum, average, etc.",
    "resolved": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The corrected code does not include any aggregation operations, which aligns with the original code. Therefore, the issue of 'Aggregation Errors' remains non-existent in the corrected code."

    "issue_number": 2,
    "issue_description": "The code does not handle missing values for all features. It only handles missing values for the 'Age' feature by filling them with the mean age.",
    "resolved": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The corrected code uses the SimpleImputer to handle missing values for both numerical and categorical features. For numerical features, it fills missing values with the mean, and for categorical features, it fills missing values with the most frequent category. Therefore, the issue of not handling missing values for all features has been resolved."

  {
    "issue_number": 3,
    "issue_description": "The code does not perform any feature scaling. Some machine learning algorithms can perform poorly if the features are not on a similar scale.",
    "resolved": "No",
    "explanation": "The corrected code still does not include any feature scaling. Although the RandomForestClassifier, which is used in the code, is not sensitive to the scale of the features, the issue of not performing feature scaling remains unresolved."
