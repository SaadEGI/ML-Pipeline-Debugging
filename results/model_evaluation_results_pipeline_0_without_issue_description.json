    "issue_description": "The code is replacing all 'native-country' values with 'North America'. This will cause loss of potentially important information.",
    "resolved": "Yes",
    "explanation": "In the corrected code, the 'native-country' values are not replaced with 'North America'. Instead, a spatial aggregation function is used to group countries into 'North America' only if they are 'United-States', 'Canada', or 'Mexico'. This preserves the information from other countries."

    "explanation": "The corrected code uses the SMOTE technique to handle the imbalance in the target variable 'salary'. This should help to reduce bias in the model."
