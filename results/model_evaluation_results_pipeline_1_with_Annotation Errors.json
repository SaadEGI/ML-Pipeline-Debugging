    "issue_description": "The code does not handle missing values for all features in the dataset. Only the 'Age' feature is handled.",
    "resolved": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The corrected code uses the SimpleImputer class from sklearn.impute to handle missing values for both numerical and categorical features. For numerical features, it fills missing values with the mean, and for categorical features, it fills missing values with the most frequent category."

    "issue_description": "The code does not perform any feature scaling. This might affect the performance of the model if some features have a much larger scale than others.",
    "resolved": "No",
    "explanation": "The corrected code still does not perform any feature scaling. While RandomForestClassifier, the model used in this pipeline, is not sensitive to the scale of the features, it's still a good practice to include feature scaling in the preprocessing steps for consistency when switching to other models."

    "issue_description": "The code does not perform any hyperparameter tuning for the RandomForestClassifier. This might result in suboptimal performance.",
    "resolved": "No",
    "explanation": "The corrected code still does not perform any hyperparameter tuning for the RandomForestClassifier. The model is used with its default parameters, which might not yield the best performance."

    "issue_number": 4,
    "issue_description": "The code does not perform any cross-validation when splitting the dataset into a training set and a test set. This might result in overfitting or underfitting.",
    "resolved": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The corrected code uses StratifiedKFold for cross-validation, which helps to ensure that each fold is a good representative of the whole dataset. This helps to prevent overfitting or underfitting."
