The impact of bias depends on the validation strategy employed. Non-representative validation affects performance and reproducibility.
Errors in anonymization processes can obscure the clarity of the results, degrade performance, and lead to nonreproducible outcomes.
Incorrect filtering processes obscure the clarity of results, degrade performance, and result in inconsistent outcomes.
Incorrect imputations distort the clarity of the results, degrade performance, and result in non-reproducible outcomes.
Introduces unintended bias by incorporating future data into the training process, thereby inflating performance metrics and compromising reproducibility.
Erroneous slicing methods lead to inconsistent outcomes, complicate interpretability, and degrade performance.
Misleading data splits affect the interpretability and performance of the model, leading to non-reproducible results.
Incorrect problem formulation introduces biases, complicates the interpretability of the results, and may lead to inconsistent outcomes.
