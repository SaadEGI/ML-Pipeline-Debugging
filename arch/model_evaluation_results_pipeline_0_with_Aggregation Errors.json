    "issue_description": "The 'native-country' column is being replaced with 'North America' for all rows, which is incorrect if the dataset contains information about individuals from different countries.",
    "resolved": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The corrected code now applies a function 'spatial_aggregation' to the 'native-country' column that only replaces 'United-States', 'Canada', and 'Mexico' with 'North America', instead of replacing all countries. This resolves the issue of incorrectly labeling all countries as 'North America'."

    "issue_description": "The code does not handle the case where the 'salary' column could be of non-numeric type. If the 'salary' column contains non-numeric values, the train_test_split function will fail.",
    "resolved": "No",
    "explanation": "The corrected code still does not include any explicit handling or checking of the 'salary' column's data type before the train_test_split function is called. If the 'salary' column contains non-numeric values, the code may still fail."
