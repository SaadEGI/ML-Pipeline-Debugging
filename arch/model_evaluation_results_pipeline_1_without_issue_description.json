    "issue_description": "The code does not handle missing values for all features in the dataset. Only 'Age' feature's missing values are handled.",
    "resolved": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The corrected code uses the SimpleImputer class to handle missing values for both numerical and categorical features. For numerical features, it fills missing values with the mean, and for categorical features, it fills missing values with the most frequent category."

    "issue_number": 2,
    "issue_description": "The model is trained without any hyperparameter tuning. This may lead to suboptimal performance.",
    "resolved": "No",
    "explanation": "The corrected code still uses the default hyperparameters for the RandomForestClassifier. There is no implementation of GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning."

  {
    "issue_number": 3,
    "issue_description": "The code does not include any feature scaling. Some machine learning algorithms can perform poorly if the features are not on the same scale.",
    "resolved": "No",
    "explanation": "The corrected code does not include any feature scaling. There is no implementation of StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler from sklearn.preprocessing to scale the features."

  {
    "issue_number": 4,
    "issue_description": "The code does not perform any feature selection or dimensionality reduction. This can lead to overfitting if the dataset has irrelevant or redundant features.",
    "resolved": "No",
    "explanation": "The corrected code does not include any feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques. There is no implementation of PCA for dimensionality reduction or SelectKBest for feature selection."

  {
    "issue_number": 5,
    "issue_description": "The code does not perform any cross-validation. This can lead to overfitting and poor generalization to unseen data.",
    "resolved": "Yes",
    "explanation": "The corrected code uses StratifiedKFold for cross-validation, which ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data."
